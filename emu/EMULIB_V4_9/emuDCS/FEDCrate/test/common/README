We have release the first version of FEDCrate software complete
with XDAQ GUIs to the CERN CVS repository. Since I am 
not listed as a developer I used Jason's account to 
repository it.

TriDAS/emu/emuDCS/FEDCrate

Code development is ongoing...

This code was written to run with the CAEN Controller software.
All software can be compiled using the Makefile in the /FEDCrate
directory. There should be no compilation warnings or something is 
wrong. 

You need to have the CAEN VME Controller libraries and drivers installed.
(http://cmsdoc.cern.ch/~cschwick/VME/html/VMEBridges_CAEN.html)

In EmuFCrateHyperDAQ.h there is a line that will sound a siren if
an "Error" is detected on the DDU. Unfortunately this requires a one
line change to the HyperDAQ libraries. The following line must be added
to HTMLClasses.h: ATOMIC_ELEMENT (bgsound, "bgsound"); One must
 then recompile the libcgicc.so library, If you don't care comment out the 
bgsound line EmuFCrateHyperDAQ.h.

HyperDAQ GUIs are available to execute the code. As alway one 
types something like:

./xdaq.sh -c $(XDAQ_ROOT)/TriDAS/emu/emuDCS/FEDCrate/xml/EmuFCluster.xml   

The script was written to run on a single machine. It is available
in FEDCrate/xml as an example. One then runs a web browser and
accesses the page http://cmspc02:1972 (of course change cmspc02 to
your machine everywhere).

We will update the code in the next few weeks to provide VME interrupt
monitoring directly to the SOAP run control.
