sjylx

The sjy (LINUX) product contains code to operate the Jorway Model 411S SCSI Bus 
CAMAC Highway Driver and the Jorway Model 73A SCSI Bus CAMAC Crate Controller for
IBM PC compatible machines running LINUX. We provide a library for the ANSI/IEEE 
Std 758-1979 calls as well as example/test code.

This release suppports multi-user and multi-branch configurations. 
Currently, CAMAC LAMs can be polled, but do not interrupt the PC.
 
Performance tests with a 100Mhz Pentium system and the Jorway 73A showed a DMA 
startup rate of 0.2 milliseconds, and maximum data transfer rates  of 1.3 Mbyte/s 
in 16 and 24 bit mode with 32200 byte buffers. Tests with the Jorway 411S showed 
16 bit word maximum transfer rates of 330 Kbyte/s with a serial controller and 
773 Kbyte/sec with a parallel controller.  Rates were almost twice that for 24 bit 
word transfers.

Please refer to documentation included in the sjy (LINUX) product for 
installation and use.
