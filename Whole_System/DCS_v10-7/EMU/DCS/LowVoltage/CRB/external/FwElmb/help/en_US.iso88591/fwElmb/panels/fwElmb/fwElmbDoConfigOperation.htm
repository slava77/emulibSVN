      Digital Output port(s) 
      for a selected ELMB 
      that has been created in the current system. Some other information 
      regarding the ELMB is also available from this panel.</td>

      The different controls for the panel (<a href="#Figure_1">Figure 1</a>) 
      are described below:<p><b><i>Firmware</i></b></p>
      <p>The three fields here are read only fields. The information is set into 
      the text fields when the information is read from the ELMB. You cannot 
      alter these values. They show the:</p>
      <p><i>Software version</i> - In some cases (depending on the version) a 
      'sub-version' may also be displayed</p>
      <p><i>Hardware version</i> - The hardware version is displayed</p>
      <p><i>Serial Number</i> - In most cases (apart from <b>very</b> old ELMBs) 
      the serial number of the ELMB is displayed. If this information is not 
      held in the ELMB, the text 'N/A' will be displayed (as it is 
      Non-Applicable).</p>
      <p><b><i>Initialization of Digital Output Lines</i></b></p>
      <p>When a hard reset is performed on an ELMB, the digital output lines are 
      initialized. You may select whether these lines should be initialized to 
      high or low in this situation. As this setting is an initialization 
      setting, you must save this configuration setting to EEPROM to have any 
      effect.</p>
      <p><b><i>Read and Write</i></b></p>
      <p><i>Read - </i>Clicking the button labeled 'Read' causes the OPC Server 
      to request all the information from the ELMB that may be displayed in the 
      panel. If successful, all values currently set into the ELMB are shown in 
      the relevant fields. Please note, that these values may NOT be the values 
      saved into the EEPROM of the ELMB - they are the current settings. If you 
      wish to read the values that are stored in the EEPROM, first <i>Reset</i> 
      the ELMB, and once the bootup message has been received, you may then read 
      the values.</p>
      <p><i>Write</i> - Clicking on the button labeled 'Write' causes the values 
      currently selected in the panel to be written to the ELMB. After clicking 
      this button, you are given a choice whether to save these settings to 
      EEPROM or not. Once the values are saved to the EEPROM (non-volatile 
      memory), they will become the default configuration settings for the ELMB 
      and therefore will still apply even after a <i>Reset</i> NMT command or a 
      Hard Reset (power-off and power-on).</p>
      <p>Upon success for either of these operations, some status text is 
      displayed indicating this. If for any reason, a problem occurs, this will 
      also be displayed.<tr valign="top">
