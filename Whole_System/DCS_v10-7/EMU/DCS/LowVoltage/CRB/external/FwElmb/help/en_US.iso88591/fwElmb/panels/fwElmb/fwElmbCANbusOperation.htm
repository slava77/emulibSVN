      There are three main 'sections' to this panel (<a href="#Figure_1">Figure 1</a>):<p>
      <b><i>Table Showing Information</i></b></p>
      <p>There are a number of columns shown in this table. Below is a brief 
      description of what information is shown in each column.</p>
      <p><i>Elmb Name</i> - The name given to the ELMB at creation time is 
      dispayed</p>
      <p><i>ID</i> - The node ID of the ELMB</p>
      <p><i>AI</i> - The count of Analog Inputs that have been defined for this 
      ELMB</p>
      <p><i>AO</i> - The count of Analog Outputs that have been defined for this 
      ELMB</p>
      <p><i>DI</i> - The count of Digital Inputs that have been defined for this 
      ELMB</p>
      <p><i>DO</i> - The count of Digital Outputs that have been defined for 
      this ELMB</p>
      <p><i>Bootup</i> - The column displays the count of bootup messages that 
      have been received from this ELMB since the last time the OPC Server was 
      started. The timestamp of the last bootup message is also shown.</p>
      <p><i>Status</i> - This column displays the state of the ELMB. This value 
      is updated each time a Node Guard request is sent to the ELMB, as the ELMB 
      then responds with a message indicating this information. If the ELMB does 
      not respond, this is indicated in this column as DISCON.</p>
      <p><i>Error</i> - The column displays the error register value that is 
      received from this ELMB when an error occurs. The timestamp of the last 
      update is also shown.</p>
      <p><b><i>Send message to all nodes on the bus</i></b></p>
      <p>Various operations are available from this section which apply to the 
      CANbus.</p>
      <p><i>Start</i> - Clicking this button sends an NMT (Network ManagemenT) 
      command to the CANbus that starts (or sets operational) all ELMBs.</p>
      <p><i>Stop</i> - Clicking this button sends an NMT Stop command to all 
      ELMBs on the CANbus.</p>
      <p><i>Reset</i> - Clicking this button sends an NMT Reset command to all 
      ELMBs on the CANbus. This will cause the ELMBs to re-boot, and 
      therefore a bootup message should be seen from each node.<p><b><i>Send 
      message to selected node</i></b><p>Three operations are available from this section. You must select an 
      ELMB from the table (by clicking on the required row) before you can send a message to the 
      ELMB.</p>
      <p><i>Start</i> - Clicking this button sends an NMT (Network ManagemenT) 
      command to the selected ELMB that starts (or sets operational) the ELMB.</p>
      <p><i>Stop</i> - Clicking this button sends an NMT Stop command to the 
      selected ELMB.</p>
      <p><i>Reset</i> - Clicking this button sends an NMT Reset command to the 
      selected ELMB. This will cause the ELMB to re-boot, and 
      therefore a bootup message should be seen from the selected node.<p><i>
      Sync. interval (ms)</i> - This displays the SYNC interval (the time period 
      between successive SYNC messages being sent to the CANbus). This value can 
      be changed by clicking on this field, altering the value and then pressing 
      &lt;Enter&gt;. As indicated, the value is given in milliseconds.<p><i>Node guard 
      interval (ms)</i> - This displays the Node Guard Interval (the time period 
      between successive Node Guard messages being sent to the CANbus). 
      Clicking on this field allows you to alter the value, and then press 
      &lt;Enter&gt; for the value to be applied. As indicated, the value is given in 
      milliseconds.<br>
