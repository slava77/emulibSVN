1) <required>fwCore=3.1.0</required>
   means they use old pvss pvss 3.1
  and not the FSM_25_25

2) <file>./panels/objects/fwCaenBoardSY1527SingleSymbolA1733BP.pnl</file>

Shoule be like this: ?
  <file>./panels/objects/fwCaen/fwCaenBoardSY1527SingleSymbolA1733BP.pnl</file>
Did they test the comonent?

4) Important: to check: do they really test the SYSTEM NAME in the panels?


Impression: they did not install the component (did not test component installation)

4) <dplist>./dplist/CMS_ME11_CSC_ME_11_HV_1.dpl</dplist>
