			     TERMS AND CONDITIONS
			     ====================

This software has been made freely available with a request for
collaborative input subject to standard Fermitools Terms and Conditions
given in full below.

                             PRODUCT DESCRIPTION
                             ===================
CAMAC is a Modular Instrumentation and Digital Interface System defined as a 
standardized instrumentation system for Computer Automated Measurement and Control. 
The system features a fully specified data highway together with modular functional 
units that are completely compatible and that are available from diverse sources. 

CAMAC hardware and software has been defined by the NIM Committee (National 
Instrumentation Methods Committee) of the U.S. Department of Energy and the ESONE
Committee (European Standards on Nuclear Electronics Committee) of European 
Laboratories. The software packages that we present here follow the ANSI/IEEE Standard
758-1979. These subroutines have been in use at Fermilab for several years, 
traditionally with UNIBUS and QBUS computers. The CAMAC product has been implemented
to enable re-use of existing hardware and software with the LINUX operating 
systems. For each operating system, the CAMAC product contains the
ESONE/IEEE CAMAC standard routines library and drivers where necessary. 

CAMAC products support various combinations of platforms, operating systems and 
CAMAC controllers. Please see the product specific README files for more information.


Under LINUX the following CAMAC interfaces are supported: 

     sjyLX - Jorway 411 SCSI to Serial and Parallel CAMAC interface and the 
             Jorway Model 73A SCSI Bus CAMAC Crate Controller. 


Documentation
-------------
Documentation is provided for each operating
system/CAMAC controller platform package.


Required Hardware and Software
------------------------------
Special hardware or operating system versions
are specified in the documentation for each product.


Product Installation
--------------------
Installation instructions are provided in the documentation for each
product.

				   SUPPORT
				   =======

Help with the installation or use of CAMAC is available by sending mail to

			CAMAC-support@fnal.gov

which is auto-forwarded to the group in charge of CAMAC support at Fermilab.

This software is furnished by Fermilab on an "as is" basis as a service 
to the wider community with the goal of stimulating collaborative use and 
further development.

Provision of the software implies no commitment of support by Fermilab.

The Fermilab Computing Division is open to discussing other levels of 
support for use of the software with responsible and committed users and 
collaborators.

Use of the software in experiments at Fermilab will be assured of a level 
of support as agreed to through the standard Memorandum Of Understanding 
process.

Users may send mail to the mail address given above, with the expectation 
that it will be read and noted.

Fermitools Special Products
---------------------------
Because of the special support needed for a few selected products Fermilab 
is only able to support the software under special agreement. The support 
offered will be discussed and negotiated on an individual basis and may be 
different for different users. To initiate discussions send mail to the 
mail address given above.
